## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the process of requirement analysis for a booking management system. It outlines key concepts, activities, and visual representations that form the foundation of software development planning. The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario and produce industry-standard documentation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders collaborate to understand, document, and validate the needs of a system. It involves identifying what the software must do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). This process ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, reducing risks and improving project outcomes.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Prevents Miscommunication**  
  Clear documentation of requirements ensures that all stakeholdersâ€”developers, clients, and users are aligned. This reduces misunderstandings and costly revisions later in the project.

- **Improves Project Planning**  
  By identifying what the system must do, teams can estimate time, resources, and budget more accurately. It sets a realistic foundation for scheduling and task allocation.

- **Ensures Product Quality and User Satisfaction**  
  Well-defined requirements help developers build features that meet user needs and expectations. This leads to higher satisfaction and fewer post-launch issues.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting relevant information from stakeholders to understand the goals and constraints of the system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques like interviews, questionnaires, and workshops to uncover detailed user needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording requirements in structured formats such as user stories, use cases, or requirement specifications.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing requirements to identify gaps, conflicts, and priorities. Creating visual models to represent system behavior and interactions.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define what the system must do, its core features and operations. Based on the hotel booking architecture:

- **Hotel Managers can update listings** through the Hotel Manager App, which interacts with the Hotel Service and Hotel DB (MySQL).
- **Customers can search for hotels** using filters like location and date via the Search Service connected to ElasticSearch.
- **Users can book hotels** through the Booking Service, which handles reservation logic and interacts with the Hotel Booking DB.
- **Payment processing** is handled by a third-party Payment Service integrated with the Booking Service.
- **Notifications** are sent to customers and managers via the Notification Service, triggered by Kafka consumers.
- **View Booking Service** allows both customers and managers to access current and historical booking data.

### Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs, its quality attributes, scalability, and reliability:

- **High performance and low latency** are achieved using Redis for caching, reducing API response time and database load.
- **Scalable search functionality** is supported by ElasticSearch, optimized for fast hotel queries.
- **Database efficiency** is maintained through a Master-Slave architecture in MySQL, separating read and write operations.
- **Content delivery speed** is enhanced via CDN integration, ensuring fast access to hotel data and media.
- **Asynchronous processing and reliability** are managed using Kafka and RabbitMQ for message queuing across services.
- **Big data analytics** are enabled through Apache Spark Streaming and Hadoop, supporting business insights and user segmentation.
