## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the process of requirement analysis for a booking management system. It outlines key concepts, activities, and visual representations that form the foundation of software development planning. The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario and produce industry-standard documentation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders collaborate to understand, document, and validate the needs of a system. It involves identifying what the software must do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). This process ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, reducing risks and improving project outcomes.
