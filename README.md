## Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository documents the process of requirement analysis for a booking management system. It outlines key concepts, activities, and visual representations that form the foundation of software development planning. The goal is to simulate a real-world scenario and produce industry-standard documentation.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders collaborate to understand, document, and validate the needs of a system. It involves identifying what the software must do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). This process ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, reducing risks and improving project outcomes.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Prevents Miscommunication**  
  Clear documentation of requirements ensures that all stakeholders—developers, clients, and users—are aligned. This reduces misunderstandings and costly revisions later in the project.

- **Improves Project Planning**  
  By identifying what the system must do, teams can estimate time, resources, and budget more accurately. It sets a realistic foundation for scheduling and task allocation.

- **Ensures Product Quality and User Satisfaction**  
  Well-defined requirements help developers build features that meet user needs and expectations. This leads to higher satisfaction and fewer post-launch issues.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting relevant information from stakeholders to understand the goals and constraints of the system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques like interviews, questionnaires, and workshops to uncover detailed user needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Organizing and recording requirements in structured formats such as user stories, use cases, or requirement specifications.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing requirements to identify gaps, conflicts, and priorities. Creating visual models to represent system behavior and interactions.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that documented requirements are accurate, complete, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.
